# Loot Collector
### What is Loot Collector
Loot Collector is an iPhone game, made in Xcode version 12.0 targeted for iOS version 14.0, that tests your reaction time. The game can be downloaded from the app store [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/loot-collector/id1533012748). 

The rules are simple. As circles start appearing on the screen, you have to press on them before they shrink to oblivion. Otherwise, if one circle disappears before you press it, then you will lose the game. Gold coins and bombs will also show up on the screen as the game progresses, and not pressing on these items before they disappear will not result in a loss. Depending on which item you click on, you will either gain or lose a certain amount of points:

• Circle = +1 point

• Gold coin = +5 points

• Bomb = lose half of your current total points
